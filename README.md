# Sitecore Login From External App
There are scenarios in which the client might request that users which are part of an external system (for example the companyâ€™s internal system) should be able to login into the Siteocre. The fastest and the simplest way is to do it via custom implementation and virtual users.
Virtual User: https://sdn.sitecore.net/Articles/Security/Faking%20user%20roles/Virtual%20user.aspx

In this Project I have created actual user rather than virtual user. To do this, there is no need to create or inject custom processor in the pipeline.

## Solution:
I have created a simple Asp.net webform project with a single page called "LoginExternal.aspx". You need to copy this file into your Website directory. And also copy the "Sitecore.Login.External.dll" into your Website-> bin directory.

From the browser pass username as query string: <sitecore Instance>/LoginExternal.aspx?username="EverDeen" , a User "EverDeen" will be created with admin privilage and you will land into the Launchpad !!

Have fun! Happy coding!
